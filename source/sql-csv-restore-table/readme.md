Database CSV Importer - Instruction Guide

This document provides detailed instructions for running the Python script that imports data from a CSV file into a MySQL database.

Prerequisites:

- Ensure Python 3.x is installed on your machine.
- Install required Python libraries: numpy, pandas, and mysql-connector-python. You can install these using the command:
  pip install numpy pandas mysql-connector-python

Configuration:

1. Database Setup:

   - Make sure you have MySQL server installed and it is running.
   - Obtain the database connection details such as host, user, password, port, and the name of the database.

2. Prepare Your CSV File:

   - Ensure that the CSV file is ready and formatted correctly.
   - The column names in the CSV should match the expected columns in the MySQL table or be properly mapped in the script.

3. Script Setup:
   - Open the script in a text editor or an IDE.
   - Update the database connection details in the script with your actual database host, user, password, port, and database name.
   - Set the path to your CSV file in the script where it reads "path/to/your.csv".
   - If your CSV column names are different from the database column names, update the renaming section in the script accordingly.
   - Check and update the SQL commands for creating and inserting data into the database to ensure they match your database schema.

Usage:

- Run the script by opening a terminal or command prompt, navigate to the directory containing your script, and execute:
  python script_name.py
  Replace 'script_name.py' with the name of your Python script file.

Important Notes:

- The script performs commits after each row insertion, which may be slow for large datasets. Consider modifying the script for batch processing if efficiency is a concern.
- Proper error handling is in place for basic database connectivity issues. Further exception handling may be required based on additional needs.

Customization:

- The script can be customized further to handle various data types, include more complex SQL queries, or to perform additional data processing before insertion.

Support:

- For troubleshooting, enhancements, or more information, refer to the documentation or contact support through the provided channels.
